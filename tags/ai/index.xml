      <description>Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been revolutionary, but its rapid growth has come with significant environmental costs. Training and deploying large-scale AI models require substantial computational resources, resulting in increased energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. This tutorial addresses these challenges by introducing energy-efficient deep learning practices and tools to measure, analyze, and mitigate the carbon footprint of AI systems.
The goals of this tutorial are:
 Educate participants on the environmental impact of AI and the importance of sustainable practices.</description>
