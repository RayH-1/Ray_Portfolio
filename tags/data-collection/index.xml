      <description>Use IMF API to automatically collect relevant data soures Process data as needed Create metrics to define majority import (in this case which ever of the three countries the share of the imports are from) Combine geojson file with data so that there is a proper geospatial file with the neceesary information Creating visuals of the dataset Start to finish process in one Jupyter Notebook    GitHub Repository</description>

      <description>This project expands on the work by Sewerin, S., Kaack, L.H., KÃ¼ttel, J. et al. Towards understanding policy design through text-as-data approaches: The policy design annotations (POLIANNA) dataset. Sci Data 10, 896 (2023). https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-023-02801-z.
The POLIANNA is a dataset of policy texts from the European Union (EU) that are annotated based on theoretical concepts of policy design, which can be used to develop supervised machine learning approaches for scaling policy analysis.</description>
